		<h2>About anecdote app</h2>
		<p>According to Wikipedia:</p>

		<em>An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident.
			Occasionally humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself,
			such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative.
			An anecdote is "a story with a point."</em>

		<p>Software engineering is full of excellent anecdotes, at this app you can find the best and add more.</p>
